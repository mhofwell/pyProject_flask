<h1> Welcome to the Tracebook! </h1>

The Tracebook is a contact tracing web application meant to be used in a variety of settings from the home, and gyms to coffee shops and anywhere else a Tracebook is needed. 

Tracebook was created because in Vancouver, Canada because a lot of storefronts are using pen and paper to log customer visits.  This means lots of people touch a pen, and paper and potentailly spread Covid-19.  Its a high risk, and we're here to stop it. 

Tracebook operates on a paperless principle.  Users scan a QR code at the location, enter the location's Tracebook Number and voila their contact details are saved in a log of that location. No sign-ups necessary. 

To create a Tracebook, simply create an account and click "Add a Tracebook" to begin!  You can add location details and your dashboard will show you your Tracebooks, each Tracebook number, the number of entries in each book, and the option to download each in CSV format or delete the Tracebook its-self.  You also have a button on your navbar to view / download your QR code to place on a monitor or on a display.
